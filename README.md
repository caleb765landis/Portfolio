# Portfolio
My personal portfolio website. Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Deployed on Vercel.

## How to View
### Deployed on Vercel
This website was deployed on Vercel and viewable publicly at [this link](https://portfolio-caleb765landis.vercel.app/).

### Locally
The project can also be viewed on a local development server. I used Node.js and npm as my package manageer. If you are using these, you can run '''npm install''' to install all necessary packages and '''npm run dev''' to start the local server.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
